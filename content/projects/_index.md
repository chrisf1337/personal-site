My current side project is [Minecrust](https://github.com/chrisf1337/minecrust), a game that I'm
intending to be a Minecraft clone in Rust. I'm pretty new to the world of game development/3D
graphics, so this is mainly a learning experience in writing a game engine/voxel engine. As such,
I'm striving to write as much of the voxel engine stuff from scratch as possible. It's in its
super early stages right now, but I plan to keep chipping away at it on the weekends and after
work for as long as I can remain motivated about it.

Here's a screenshot of its current state:
