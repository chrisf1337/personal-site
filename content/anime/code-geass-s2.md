- Why does Villetta not do anything about Lelouch? The threat of her blackmail is miniscule
  compared the the gains she would have by turning him in.
- Losing interest: too many characters
  - China party---??? what is going on? Why is Zero allowed to just stroll in and play chess? And why is he just allowed to kidnap the *empress*?
  - Pinkie promise: eye roll
- Shirley's death comes out of nowhere
  - Not as well done as Euphemia's
- Jeremiah's defection: what is going on
- You're telling me that nobody noticed Lelouch building his room directly outside of the Geass research base?

- Nobody from the Britannian military thought to disable the Guren as they were fleeing the government bureau?
- Accelerating pace: Gripping
- Ok nvm it accelerated into wtf
- ...How is it that people are *surprised* when Lelouch steps onto the stage. Was there not a *single* person in the know behind the scenes? How does the Britannian government function? I have so many questions...
    - Ok, it's plausible that he's Geass'd the entire bureaucracy?
- I'm sick of these on-the-nose chess references
- Why does every mecha have a flight unit now
- Why doesn't Schneizel use the beam weapon at the beginning?
- Ending is emotional at face value but makes no sense---power vacuum?
