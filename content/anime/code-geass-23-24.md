Things I liked:

- The killing off of Euphemia was done well, even if the events leading up to it were sort of
contrived (it seems weird that Lelouch would bring up "killing all Japanese" out of nowhere). It
really raises the stakes now.
- CC's mecha pilot outfit looks nice.

- Cornelia's betrayal: Classic plot twist done nicely.

Things I didn't like:

- I never noticed this before, but Kallen's mecha pilot outfit looks outrageous:

- I'm not sure what the Britannian military's plan is with using Lancelot. They quite clearly have a
  superior mecha, but for some reason they don't build a squadron around it and instead send it
  willy-nilly dashing through enemy lines to get it captured over and over again? By the same
  trick too. What?
- Also aren't the Britannian's a little too laidback about having lost Gawain? Lelouch literally
  strolled into a cave, rode out in their OP prototype mecha (it literally flies), and all they
  have to say about is this:

  And now Lelouch is using it to obliterate their air force. This is just lazy writing.
- Haha, this is a little *too* on the nose:
