Things I liked:

- The killing off of Euphemia was done well, even if the events leading up to it were sort of
contrived (it seems weird that Lelouch would bring up "killing all Japanese" out of nowhere). It
really raises the stakes now.
- CC's mecha pilot outfit looks nice.

Things I didn't like:

- I never noticed this before, but Kallen's mecha pilot outfit looks outrageous:
