A collection of my thoughts on various anime series that I've watched.

After watching an episode (or possibly multiple episodes if I'm marathoning something), I'll
write a short post that describes my thoughts. These will be simple---simply what I liked and
what I disliked. After I finish (or drop) something, I'll then write a post that's more
review-like, evaluating the series on the following criteria using a 4 point scale and giving my
overall impression on the series:

- **Art:** This includes character design, animation, framing, backgrounds, etc. Probably the
  most important aspect of a series for me. Call me shallow, but if the art's not good, it's
  probably not going to catch or maintain my interest. I might as well read the manga if it's an
  adaptation or just watch something else entirely.
- **Story:** Also very important. General plot points, pacing, how it's presented to me, etc.
- **Soundtrack:** This includes the OP and ED. Not as important to me, but still part of the
  entire package. And if I notice the OST is good, bonus points.

Here is my [MAL](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/optikol). I tend to update it when I pick up
and finish or drop things.
